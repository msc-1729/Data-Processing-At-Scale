This repository includes the project that was done as a part of the course CSE-511. This includes technologies like Apache Spark, Hadoop and programming language Scala.
The aim of the project is to develop and run multiple spatial queries on large database of a major peer-to-peer taxi cab firm that contains geographic data as well as real- time location data of their customers.These queries are further used to perform HotZone Analysis and Hot Cell Analysis which can be used to provide an efficient way to find the taxi cab pickup points.
The whole project is divided into two phases namely phase1 and phase2.
